              making the course very cheap. The course is considered easy to
              pursue in comparison to other countries. The overall cost of the
              course is low in the country. The experience is smooth for
              international students in the country’s universities, hence the
              low tuition fees for the students. There is also the added
              advantage of not having to pay any donations. The experience of
              completing the six-year course is budget-friendly for the
              students. The cost of the course, MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and
              Bachelor of Surgery), varies depending on the country and the
              university. The overall cost of the course is low when compared to
              other countries. The cost is also likely to vary; hence, the best
              option is to check the latest updates from the university.
